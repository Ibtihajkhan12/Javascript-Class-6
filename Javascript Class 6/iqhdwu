Task # 1
Problem: Student Attendance Tracker
Write a JavaScript program to track student attendance in a class using an array. The program should:

Ask the user (teacher) to enter the number of students in the class.
Use a for loop to prompt the teacher to enter the student's name and whether the student is "Present" or "Absent".
Store the names of absent students in an array.
At the end, display a message showing how many students are present and the names of the absent students.
Requirements:
Use an array to store student names.
Use a for loop to get attendance for each student.
Use if-else statements to check whether a student is present or absent.
Use nested if statements to ensure valid input (e.g., "Present" or "Absent" only).








Task # 2
Problem: Simple Quiz App
Write a JavaScript program that conducts a quiz for a user. The program should:

Store a list of 5 questions and their correct answers in two arrays.
Use a for loop to display each question using prompt and ask for the user's answer.
Use if-else to check if the user's answer is correct.
Keep track of how many answers are correct and how many are wrong.
At the end, display the user's total score and a message based on their performance (using nested if for grading).
Requirements:
Use two arrays: one for the questions and one for the correct answers.
Use a for loop to display the questions and capture the user's answer.
Use if-else to compare the user's answer with the correct one.
Use nested if statements to give feedback based on the score (like grading A, B, C, etc.)
